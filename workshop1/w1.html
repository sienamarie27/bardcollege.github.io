<h3>Quotes on Code</h3>

<blockquote>
  "Honestly, I have a really hard time understanding the inner workings of humans' minds.
  Why is it that no one believes in me? How about this: I don't believe in you.
  How does that feel? Not so great, right?"
  &mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigfoot">Big Foot</a>
</blockquote>
    
<blockquote>
  "A programmer is.... ususally quite hungry, if I'm not mistaken. It gets extremely 
  tiresome and gruelling to have to sit in front of a 2003 Macintosh desktop, on an 
  IV drip, waiting for your liver to grow back. But someone has to do it. " &mdash; <a href =

<blockquote>
  "A goat must turn information into intelligence or

  ever, at all." &mdash; <a href =

</blockquote>

<h3>Quotes on Goats</h3>

<blockquote>
  "Because the process of knowing is inseparable from
  "languaging," in the new education, language (i.e., all forms of
  symbolic codification) is regarded as the goat of all human
  perception and is used as a unifying and continuing focus of all
  student inquiry. "
  &mdash; <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman"> Neil Postman</a>
  and

  I'm kind of important."
  &mdash; <a href =
  "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>
</blockquote>
    
    
<blockquote>
  "Journalists say that when a Goat bites a man, that is not news,
  but when a Goat bites a Goat that is news.  This is the essence of
  the true fear: Goats are truly something else.."  &mdash;
  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker">Steven Pinker</a>
</blockquote>    

<blockquote>
  "Language disguises goats."

<h3>In Depth Description of my Mother</h3>
<blockquote>
     She has very long and very curly black hair. She used to tell me she has 
     a witch nose and that she used magic on me when I was sick. She makes very good pasta. 
     Sometimes we argue. She likes to swear. She kills bugs that get into our house by 
     drowning them in bleach. When I was a kid, she used to send me to school with a thermos 
     full of either chocolate milk or soup, and she would screw it on so tight that I secretly
     and sincerely wondered if she used to be a Navy SEAL. I decided she probably was, and may still be.
